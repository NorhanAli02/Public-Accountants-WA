## Summary of Findings
Based on the analysis of the **List of Public Accountants in Washington State**, the following key insights were discovered:
1. **License Growth:** There has been consistent growth in the number of CPAs licensed over the years, with noticeable increases during specific years that might be influenced by economic conditions or regulatory changes.
2. **Active vs. Lapsed Licenses:** While most CPAs maintain active licenses, a significant portion of professionals have allowed their licenses to lapse. This suggests potential retention challenges and the need for further investigation into the reasons for lapses, such as career transitions or retirement.
3. **Geographical Insights:** Larger cities, especially Seattle, have a higher concentration of CPAs, while smaller cities and rural areas show lower concentrations. This presents opportunities for accounting firms or professionals to expand into these underserved regions.
4. **License Expiration:** Many CPAs have licenses expiring soon, indicating an opportunity for businesses and regulatory bodies to implement targeted renewal campaigns and proactive outreach.
5. **License Lapse Trends:** A notable portion of CPAs have lapsed licenses, suggesting a potential issue of workforce retention. Further investigation could help identify the causes of license lapses, including retirement or changes in career focus.

## Next Steps
Based on the findings, the following actions are recommended:

**Investigate Retention:** Understanding the reasons behind license lapses could help develop strategies to retain qualified professionals. It is important to explore career transition patterns, retirement rates, and factors that may discourage license renewal.
**Target Marketing in Underserved Areas:** Cities with fewer CPAs may present opportunities for growth, with potential marketing campaigns targeting underserved regions.
**Proactive License Renewal Campaigns:** Engage CPAs whose licenses are expiring soon with reminders and offer programs for license renewal.
